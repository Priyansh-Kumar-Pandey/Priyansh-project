hi this is just to check whether the git webhook works or not, although i've already practice it but still little out of practice
everything was good at the Jenkins side just forgot to do the changes in the github
no I'm adding the git key pass to avoid the passworf entering everytime
now on 13/09/23 I haven't configured or update the ip address of git hub webhook in the git hub will this webhook still works or not lets see.
